1. Locres_points

Locres_points is a python script based on localres written by Guillaume Gaullier (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3575229).

2. PyMOL scripts

Scripts of PyMOL were used to calculate rotational angles and to draw cylinders representing the inter-subunit movements.
Draw_rotation_axis.py is a modification of sctipt RotationAxis (https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/RotationAxis).
Modevectors.py is a modification of script Modevectors (https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/ModevectorsManifoldEM).

3. ManifoldEM

Several files here were modified from programe package "ManifoldEM" to fit our individual demands (Source link: https://github.com/GMashayekhi/ManifoldEM_Matlab). The path of modified files are identical with ManfifoldEM. 

ManifoldEM is used to canculate free-energy landscape of biological molecules and was established by A. Ourmazd's research group at at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee (UWM) (https://sites.uwm.edu/ourmazd/). The underlying methodology with application to different experimental datasets is described in the following publications.
